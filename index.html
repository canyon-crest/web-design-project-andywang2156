  <h3>My life</h3>
  <img src = "images/SparkyCard.webp" id = "pic1">
<p>I am a junior at CCA who enjoys music, sports, and playing with my cat. I have a cat whose name is <span class = "highlight">Sparky</span>. His name came from a TV show that me and my family like to watch called Avatar the Last Air Bender, inspired by a character that has a nick name sparky sparky boom man. It was also slightly inspired by the <a href = "https://supercell.com/en/games/clashroyale/" target = "_blank">Clash Royale</a> troop Sparky. Eventually, his name evolved into Pork because I thought Sparky was a little hard to say. He really likes to chase rubber bands around, so when I play with him I usually use a spare rubber band and fling it across the room and watch him chase it down.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>

<p>Music is a very important aspect of my life. I not only like listening to music, but I also enjoy playing music on piano and clarinet. Some of my favorite music creators are Wallows and The Neighbourhood. Their music helps me focus and concentrate when I am studying, and I find their music to be both calming and energizing. Additionally, <span class = "highlight">I also like to make music myself.</span> I enjoy playing <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" target = "_blank">classical pieces</a> on both the piano and clarinet. My favorite pieces to play are Chopin’s “Torrent” Etude for the piano and Mozart’s clarinet concerto, but I like to sight read other pieces that sound cool for fun as well.</p>

<h3>Sports</h3>

<p>I also enjoy sports very much, both as a way to exercise and as a way to socialize. I like to play basketball with my friends even though I am not good at it, I still enjoy playing it to connect with my friends. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football" target = "_blank" class = "highlight">Soccer</a> has been a major part of my life for many years, and soccer is the sport that I mainly play with my friends. More recently, I’ve started playing badminton, which has quickly become another enjoyable way to socialize and stay active. Although I’m still learning and not very good at it yet, I’m motivated to improve and excited to keep practicing.</p>
